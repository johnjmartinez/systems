# OBSERVATIONS
 + Child does NOT inherit signals handlers
 + Child inherits ENV 
 + GNU99 C CODE
 + signal handler for main process and child process should be different.


# BUILTINS
 - fg : only token in line? --- wait for job completion
 - bg : only token in line? -- !wait for job completion 
 - > : followed by file, redirect STDOUT
 - < : followed by file, redirect STDIN. FAIL if !exist
 - cd : first of only two tokens in line, followed by dir
 - jobs : only token in line?
 - & : last token in line ALWAYS, only one -- !wait for job completion
 - | : only one in line separates two commands 
 use boolean flag for each and check invalid combination cases
 
# BEHAVIOR 
 * after read line check if any job exited ... print to STDOUT if so
 * two commands max (if not using |, only one) per job
 * no STDERR redirects?
 * command + args + redirects if any 
 * only one <, and if necessary before > or |
 * only one >, and if necessary only after |
 
# NOT SURE
 % implement + integrate job control table
 % SIGCHLD, SIGCONT? ... SIGTTIN? SIGTTOU? 
 % tcsetpgrp() ... setpgid() ...
