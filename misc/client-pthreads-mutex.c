       what type of address we're using), and as a way to return the addresses associated
       to a given hostname and service. For example, "www.google.com" (with service "http")
       might resolve to multiple IP addresses, and one port (80). So, addrinfo is
       actually a linked list:

           struct addrinfo {

               struct addrinfo *ai_next;

       Note how it contains information used in other socket functions (family, socket type, etc.)
       and the sockaddr for the address.
